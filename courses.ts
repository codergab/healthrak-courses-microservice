All components of a HACCP plan are important. The most intensive task is conducting a hazard analysis. A thoroughly and properly conducted hazard analysis will ensure the proper critical control points are identified. Training in conducting a hazard analysis and identifying significant and likely hazards is key to implementing an effective HACCP plan and food safety system. The process of conducting a hazard analysis involves evaluating each step of the process and determining what biological, chemical or physical hazards are introduced, controlled or exists. The likelihood and severity of the hazard is also analyzed, and justification for the decision is also needed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>\r\n<p>Training manuals</p>\r\n<p>Tea and lunch break</p>\r\n<p>Certification</p>',

ATLS was developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Committee on Trauma (COT) and was first introduced in the US and abroad in 1980. Its courses provide you with a safe and reliable method for immediate management of injured patients. The course teaches you how to</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Assess a patient&rsquo;s condition</li>\r\n<li>Resuscitate and stabilize him or her</li>\r\n<li>Determine if his or her needs exceed a facility&rsquo;s capacity</li>\r\n<li>It also covers how to arrange for a patient&rsquo;s inter-hospital transfer and assure that optimum care is provided throughout the process.</li>\r\n<li>If you don&rsquo;t treat trauma patients frequently, an ATLS course provides an easy method to remember for evaluation and treatment of a trauma victim.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Injured patients present a wide range of complex problems. The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) Student Course presents a concise approach to assessing and managing multiply injured patients. The course presents doctors with knowledge and techniques that are comprehensive and easily adapted to fit their needs. The skills described in the manual represent one safe way to perform each technique, and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) recognizes that there are other acceptable approaches. However, the knowledge and skills taught in the course are easily adapted to all venues for the care of patients.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For Whom</strong>: Medical Doctors and Surgeons</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Training manuals</li>\r\n<li>Tea and lunch break</li>\r\n<li>Intensive practical sessions</li>\r\n<li>Certification</li>\r\n</ul>',
